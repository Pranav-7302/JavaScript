// Problem Statement 3

// Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

function PositiveOrNot(number){
(number>0)? console.log("Number is positive") : (number<0)? console.log("Number is negative") : console.log("Number is zero")
