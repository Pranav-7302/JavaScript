    <h2>
      Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their
      functionality. Provide examples for each category.
    </h2>

    <h3>Types of JavaScript Operators</h3>
    <h3>1. Arithmetic Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      Arithmetic operators are used to do mathematical operations like addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It simply takes numerical
      values as operands, performs an arithmetic operation, and returns a
      numerical value.

      <pre>
      Example:- 
      a=2; 
      b=2; 
      c=a+b;

      The output of the code is :-4
    </pre
      >
    </h4>
    <hr />
    <h3>2. Assignment Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      The assignment (=) operator is used to assign a value to a variable or
      property. The assignment expression itself has a value, which is the
      assigned value. This allows multiple assignments to be chained in order to
      assign a single value to multiple variables.
    </h4>
    <pre>
let x = 2;
const y = 3;

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 2

console.log((x = y + 1)); // 3 + 1
// Expected output: 4

console.log((x = x * y)); // 4 * 3
// Expected output: 12
    </pre>

    <h3>3. Comparison Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality
      or difference between variables or values.
    </h4>
    <pre>
        JavaScript Comparison Operators
Operator	Description
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator
    </pre>
    <hr />
    <h3>4. String Operators</h3>
    <pre>
        JavaScript String Comparison
All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:

Example
let text1 = "A";
let text2 = "B";
let result = text1 < text2;
    </pre>
    <hr />
    <h3>5. Logical Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or
      values.
    </h4>
    <pre>
        JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator	Description
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not
    </pre>
    <hr />
    <h3>6. Bitwise Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. Any numeric operand in the
      operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back
      to a JavaScript number.
    </h4>
    <pre>
        Operator	   Description	  Example	Same as	Result	Decimal
&	      AND	          5 & 1	      0101 & 0001	0001	  1
|	       OR	          5 | 1	      0101 | 0001	0101	  5
~	      NOT	           ~ 5	      ~0101	 1010	 10       10
^	      XOR	          5 ^ 1	      0101 ^ 0001	0100	  4
<<	   left shift	      5 << 1	  0101 << 1	    1010	  10
>>	   right shift	      5 >> 1	  0101 >> 1	    0010	  2
>>>  unsigned right shift 5 >>> 1	  0101 >>> 1	0010	  2
    </pre>
    <hr />
    <h3>7. Ternary Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that
      takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an
      expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:),
      and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This
      operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
    </h4>
    <pre>
            Syntax

condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

        </pre
    >
    <hr />
    <h3>8. Type Operators</h3>
    <pre>
   
    Operator	Description
typeof - Returns the type of a variable
instanceof - Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
