    <h2>
      Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in
      JavaScript. Give examples of each.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands,
      which can be values or variables. These operators can be categorized based
      on the number of operands they take:
    </h2>
<hr>
    <h3>Unary Operators:</h3>
    <pre>
Unary operators are those that operate on a single operand.
Examples include:
Unary plus (+): Converts its operand into a number, if it isn't already. If the operand is not a number, it attempts to convert it to one.
javascript
Copy code
var x = "10";
console.log(+x); // Output: 10
Unary minus (-): Negates its operand.
javascript
Copy code
var y = 5;
console.log(-y); // Output: -5
Logical NOT (!): Converts its operand to a boolean value and returns the inverse.
javascript
Copy code
var isTrue = false;
console.log(!isTrue); // Output: true</pre
    >

    <hr />
    <h3>Binary Operators:</h3>
    <pre>
Binary operators operate on two operands.
Examples include:
Addition (+): Adds two operands or concatenates two strings.
javascript
Copy code
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
console.log(a + b); // Output: 15
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
javascript
Copy code
var c = 10;
var d = 3;
console.log(c - d); // Output: 7
Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
javascript
Copy code
var e = 20;
</pre
    >

    <hr />
    <h3>Ternary Operator:</h3>
    <pre>
The ternary operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands.
It's a conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false.
Syntax: condition ? value1 : value2
Example:
javascript
Copy code
var age = 20;
var status = (age >= 18) ? "adult" : "minor";
console.log(status); // Output: adult
In this example, if the condition (age >= 18) is true, the value "adult" is assigned to the variable status; otherwise, the value "minor" is assigned.
These are the primary categories of operators in JavaScript based on the number of operands they take. Each category has specific operators with distinct behaviors.</pre
