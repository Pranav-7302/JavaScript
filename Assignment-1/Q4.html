      Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript.
      Why is understanding these concepts important?
    </h2>

    <h2><pre>
      In JavaScript, precedence and associativity are two important concepts
      that determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an
      expression. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing correct
      and predictable code. Let's discuss each concept:

    <pre>
1. Precedence:-

Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present in an expression.
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first, followed by operators with lower precedence.

Parentheses () can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation.

JavaScript operators have different precedence levels, with higher precedence operators being 
evaluated first. For example, multiplication (*) has a higher precedence than addition (+).

Example:

var result = 2 + 3 * 4; // Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+)
console.log(result); // Output: 14 (3 * 4 = 12, 2 + 12 = 14)


2. Associativity:-

Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.
It specifies whether an expression is evaluated from left to right (left-associative) or right
 to left (right-associative).

Most operators in JavaScript are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.

However, some operators, such as the assignment operators (=), are right-associative, meaning they are evaluated from right to left.

var a = 10;
var b = 5;
var c = 2;
var result = a = b = c; // Assignment operators are right-associative
console.log(result); // Output: 2 (c is assigned to b, and then b is assigned to a)
